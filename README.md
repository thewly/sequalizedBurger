Burger App - Sequelized

This is an app to help you keep track of the burgers you want to eat/have eaten. 

Once the app has loaded, you can enter a burger in the entry field & check whether or not you've eaten it yet. 

If you enter a burger that you haven't devoured yet, when it pushes to the table on the left there will be a 'devour' button option which will push it from the 'two eat' to the 'devoured' table.

This is the same as the previous Burger app, but the database on this version relies on Sequelized, not manually built ORMs.
