Burger App

This is an app to help you keep track of the burgers you want to eat/have eaten. 

Once the app has loaded, you can enter a burger in the entry field & check whether or not you've eaten it yet. 

If you enter a burger that you haven't devoured yet, when it pushes to the table on the left there will be a 'devour' button option which will push it from the 'two eat' to the 'devoured' table.
